# Reflection

This final milestone represents the culmination of our dashboard development efforts. We have implemented numerous features from our original proposal and refined our design based on feedback, leading to a more polished and user-friendly product.

## Implemented & Refined Features

Since Milestone 3, our group has integrated several key improvements:
- **Consistent Color Encoding:** We introduced a global sector-to-color dictionary so that all charts (pie, scatter, and bar) use the same colors for each sector. This consistency has made the dashboard easier to interpret and more professional in appearance.
- **Enhanced Interactivity:** We added multi-select filtering for sectors, allowing users to explore data by selecting specific sectors. In addition, we implemented a Top 5/Bottom 5 bar chart for intraday contribution, which quickly highlights the most significant movers.
- **Optimized Layout:** Our 2×2 grid layout now neatly displays all primary visualizations on one page. We adjusted margins and padding based on peer feedback to reduce unnecessary gaps and ensure each chart “pops” without overwhelming the viewer.
- **Pinned Sidebar & Data Tabs:** We refined the sidebar’s design to keep essential filters always visible and created separate tabs for visualizations and data exploration, enhancing the overall navigation and usability of the dashboard.

## Insights & Feedback

One of the most valuable pieces of feedback was the recommendation to unify our color schemes. Once we standardized the colors across different charts, our visualizations became significantly more cohesive and easier to understand. In addition, detailed suggestions on adjusting spacing and layout helped us eliminate clutter and improve readability.

We also appreciated guidance on how to incorporate interactive elements, which pushed us to explore new methods of data filtering and visualization. However, more resources on responsive design for pinned sidebars and mobile layouts would have further enhanced our ability to create a truly adaptive dashboard.

## Limitations & Future Improvements

While our dashboard now successfully provides a comprehensive snapshot of the NASDAQ 100, some limitations remain:
- **Responsive Design:** The current layout works well on larger screens but could be further optimized for smaller devices. A more responsive sidebar and dynamic scaling of charts would improve mobile usability.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Although our dashboard includes refresh intervals, the update mechanism could be more robust during non-trading hours or periods of low activity.
- **Advanced Analytics:** We have focused on descriptive analytics; however, integrating predictive elements (e.g., regression analysis, machine learning forecasts) could add significant value.

## Deviations & Final Thoughts

We intentionally deviated from some of the best practices learned in 531 regarding strict responsive design in favor of a pinned sidebar, as we felt it enhanced quick data filtering. While this approach may limit mobile responsiveness, it serves our primary goal of offering an immediately accessible and informative overview during trading hours.

In summary, our dashboard now offers consistent visual encoding, improved interactivity, and a clear layout. Although there are still opportunities for enhanced responsiveness and advanced analytics, the current version meets our core objectives and provides a strong foundation for future development.
