# Reflection

This milestone felt like the culmination of our efforts to bring the dashboard to life. We’ve implemented a range of features that not only meet our initial proposal but also incorporate valuable feedback from peers. In this reflection, I’ll walk through the changes we made, the insights we gained, and areas we see for future improvements.

## Implemented Features

Since Milestone 3, we have made several significant updates. We unified the color schemes across our charts by implementing a global sector-to-color dictionary. This ensures that every chart—from the pie chart to the scatter plot—displays consistent hues for each sector, which makes the dashboard easier to interpret at a glance. We also added interactive filtering; users can now select multiple sectors from a dropdown to refine the visualizations, which has made our data exploration much more dynamic.

Another major enhancement was the introduction of a Top 5/Bottom 5 bar chart for intraday contributions. This not only highlights the extremes but also provides a quick visual summary of the companies making the biggest moves. Additionally, we refined the layout to display our key visualizations in a 2×2 grid, ensuring that everything fits on one page without overwhelming the user with scrolling. The pinned sidebar was adjusted based on feedback to keep it visible at all times without detracting from the main charts.

## Insights & Feedback

One of the most useful pieces of feedback we received was to standardize the color encoding across charts. Once we aligned our color schemes, the overall look of the dashboard became much more polished. We also learned that minor CSS tweaks—such as adjusting margins, padding, and box shadows—can have a major impact on how “stand out” the charts appear. For instance, reducing extra spacing and adding subtle backgrounds to each chart container helped each element pop without feeling cluttered.

On the other hand, we would have appreciated more guidance on creating responsive layouts, especially given the challenges we faced with the fixed sidebar. While the current layout works well on larger screens, smaller devices still feel a bit cramped. This is something we hope to address in future iterations.

## What’s Working & Future Improvements

Overall, the dashboard now offers a cohesive snapshot of the NASDAQ 100 companies. The consistent visuals, interactive filters, and detailed charts provide users with clear insights into market performance. However, there are still a few areas for improvement. For example, making the layout fully responsive to various screen sizes would be a major upgrade. In addition, we’d like to explore more advanced analytics and predictive elements if time allowed, such as real-time data integration and machine learning-based trend analysis.

In summary, while our dashboard already meets our core objectives, we see plenty of opportunities to further refine and enhance its functionality and usability. The feedback we received was invaluable, and the process taught us much about balancing design, technical implementation, and user experience.
