# Reflection

This final milestone represents the culmination of our dashboard development efforts. We have implemented numerous features from our original proposal and refined our design based on feedback, leading to a more polished and user-friendly product.

## Implemented & Refined Features

Since Milestone 3, our group has integrated several key improvements:

- **Consistent Color Encoding:** We introduced a global sector-to-color dictionary so that all charts (pie, scatter, and bar) use the same colors for each sector. This consistency has made the dashboard easier to interpret and more professional in appearance.
- **Optimized Layout:** Our 2×2 grid layout now neatly displays all primary visualizations on one page. We adjusted margins and padding based on peer feedback to reduce unnecessary gaps and ensure each chart “pops” without overwhelming the viewer.
- **Customizable Data Table:** The table is now customizable with selectable columns, and filters can be applied to the columns, alongside sorting and a search box. This improvement enhances the user’s ability to explore and interact with the data more effectively.
- **Commentary for Guidance:** A refresh time indicator was added to the sidebar to show when the data was last updated. Additionally, we included a commentary section that offers guidance on interactivity, a glossary of financial terms, and a beta definition on the Stock tab to clarify the term's relevance and its application in the data.

## Insights & Feedback

One of the most valuable pieces of feedback was the recommendation to unify our color schemes. Once we standardized the colors across different charts, our visualizations became significantly more cohesive and easier to understand. In addition, detailed suggestions on adjusting spacing and layout helped us eliminate clutter and improve readability.

We also appreciated guidance on how to incorporate interactive elements, which pushed us to explore new methods of data filtering and visualization. However, more resources on responsive design for pinned sidebars and mobile layouts would have further enhanced our ability to create a truly adaptive dashboard.

## Limitations & Future Improvements

While our dashboard now successfully provides a comprehensive snapshot of the NASDAQ 100, some limitations remain:
- **Responsive Design:** The current layout works well on larger screens but could be further optimized for smaller devices. A more responsive sidebar and dynamic scaling of charts would improve mobile usability.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Although our dashboard includes refresh intervals, the update mechanism could be more robust during non-trading hours or periods of low activity.
- **Advanced Analytics:** We have focused on descriptive analytics; however, integrating predictive elements (e.g., regression analysis, machine learning forecasts) could add significant value.

## Deviations & Final Thoughts

Our intentional deviation from best visualization practices continues to be the same as explained in Milestone 2. This approach has also been addressed in the peer review feedback, particularly regarding the necessity of coloring by industry sectors.

In summary, our dashboard now offers consistent visual encoding, improved interactivity, and a clear layout. Although there are still opportunities for enhanced responsiveness and advanced analytics, the current version meets our core objectives and provides a strong foundation for future development.
