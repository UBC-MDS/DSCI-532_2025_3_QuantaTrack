# QuantaTrack

This project is about making a dynamic dashboard of NASDAQ100 tracking.

## ðŸ“– The Problem

Investors often struggle with navigating complex and overwhelming market data to identify key trends and make informed investment decisions. 
With an abundance of financial information, tracking performance metrics and staying updated with real-time insights becomes challenging, 
especially when dealing with fast-evolving markets like the NASDAQ 100. 
Many investors are left with fragmented data, making it difficult to draw actionable conclusions and plan effective investment strategies.

## ðŸ’¡ The Solution

QuantaTrack addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive, real-time dashboard designed to monitor the NASDAQ 100. 
By consolidating essential performance metrics and visualizing trends, 
it empowers investors to quickly assess market movements and individual stock performance. 
With an intuitive interface and advanced analytics tools, QuantaTrack offers a streamlined platform that helps users stay informed 
and make confident, data-driven investment decisions in a dynamic market environment.

## ðŸ’» Usage

### Overview

The QuantaTrack dashboard is organized into a sidebar for user input and a data display section. 

In the sidebar, users can filter data by sector, allowing for a customized view of the data. 
The data display section offers real-time insights on key performance metrics, 
including intraday performance, sector composition, and stock metrics like dividend yield and PE ratio. 

Below the charts, users can also select their preferred refresh interval for the stock screener table, 
with updates available every 3 or 10 seconds. 
The search box allows users to find specific tickers or company names in the table, 
and they can download the data in CSV format based on the current view for further analysis.
