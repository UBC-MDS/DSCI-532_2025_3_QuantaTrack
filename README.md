# QuantaTrack

This project is about making a dynamic dashboard of NASDAQ100 tracking.

## 📖 The Problem
  
Investors often struggle with navigating complex and overwhelming market data to identify key trends and make informed investment decisions. 
With an abundance of financial information, tracking performance metrics and staying updated with real-time insights becomes challenging, 
especially when dealing with fast-evolving markets like the NASDAQ 100. 
Many investors are left with fragmented data, making it difficult to draw actionable conclusions and plan effective investment strategies.

## 💡 The Solution

QuantaTrack addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive, real-time dashboard designed to monitor the NASDAQ 100. 
By consolidating essential performance metrics and visualizing trends, 
it empowers investors to quickly assess market movements and individual stock performance. 
With an intuitive interface and advanced analytics tools, QuantaTrack offers a streamlined platform that helps users stay informed 
and make confident, data-driven investment decisions in a dynamic market environment.

## 💻 Usage

### Overview

The QuantaTrack dashboard is organized into a sidebar with global widgets for user input and three data display tabs for a streamlined and interactive experience. 
The sidebar allows users to filter data by sector, providing a customized view of the data. 
Additionally, users can select their preferred refresh interval for the stock screener table, with updates available every 3 or 10 seconds.

In the data display section, the Dashboard tab offers real-time insights on key performance metrics, 
including intraday performance, sector composition, return distribution 
and stock metrics like dividend yield and PE ratio. 
The Stock tab allows users to perform beta analysis for a specified duration and stock, 
offering deeper insights into stock performance. 
Finally, the Table tab presents a stock screener with search, filter, and sort capabilities, 
enabling users to easily find specific tickers or company names or criteria. 
Users can also customize the table by selecting which columns to display, 
making the data more adaptable to individual needs, 
and download the data in CSV format based on the current view for further analysis.
