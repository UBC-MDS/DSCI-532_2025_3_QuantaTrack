# Contributing

**QuantaTrack** is an open-source dashboard project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: 
new features, bug fixes, suggestions for improvements, and updates to the documentation are all appreciated.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing to **QuantaTrack**, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](./LICENSE). 
In return, we will review your contributions and address any issues as quickly as possible.

### How to Contribute

There are several ways to get started with contributing to **QuantaTrack**. 
Whether you’re submitting an issue or contributing code, we welcome all types of feedback and collaboration.

1. If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments by email][contact]. 
However, using GitHub is more efficient for quick responses.

2. If you have a [GitHub][github] account (or are willing to [create one][github-join]) but are not familiar with Git, 
you can report issues or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][new-issues]. 
This allows us to keep track of the problem and respond quickly.

3. If you are comfortable with Git and would like to contribute code, you can submit a pull request (PR). 
The instructions for doing this are outlined below.

### Using GitHub

If you want to contribute via GitHub, we follow [GitHub flow][github-flow] for managing changes. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch** for each significant change.
3. **Make your changes** and commit them in the new branch.
4. **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub.
5. **Submit a pull request (PR)** from your branch to the main repository. Be sure to tag a project administrator to review your PR.
6. If you receive feedback, make any necessary changes, commit them, and push them to your branch: the PR will automatically update.

### What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to **QuantaTrack**:

- **Documentation:** Improve the documentation for the dashboard app, including setup instructions, usage guides, or API documentation.
- **Design and UI Improvements:** Contribute to improving the user interface and experience (UX).

### Contribution Guidelines

#### Implement Features

If you are proposing a new feature:

- Provide a clear explanation of how the feature will work.
- Keep the scope of the feature as focused as possible, making it easier for others to review and integrate.
- Be aware that this is a volunteer-driven project, and contributions are welcome!

#### Report Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include the following:

- The **browser** and **OS** you are using, as well as the version.
- A **step-by-step description** of how to reproduce the issue.
- Screenshots or error logs, if applicable, to help us understand the problem.

#### Write Documentation

We value comprehensive documentation to help other users understand and contribute to the project. You can contribute by:

- Improving the documentation for the dashboard or app’s features.
- Helping others by writing usage guides, tutorials, or troubleshooting tips.
- Reviewing existing documentation for clarity and completeness.

### What *Not* to Contribute

We are not looking for contributions that:

- Are **platform-specific** and do not work across different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, and Linux). 
The dashboard should be cross-platform and work consistently for all users.
- Include **unnecessary features** or changes that may complicate the user experience without clear benefit.
